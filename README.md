## React front end app to demonstrate React createContext and useContext hooks to retrieve API data



1. Create a React Context and provide a Context Provider functional component.


2. Provide a means for components to use the Context you created.


3. Write a Netlify function that will retrieve your API data and provide it to your React component(s).


4. Your Context component has at least one side effect that is handled using the useEffect hook
